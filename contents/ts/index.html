        <h1>Installation and Initial Configurations</h1>
        <h2>What and Why I Recommend Those</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Either the WebStorm or the Visual Studio. Microsoft Code is nice but Intellisense
                especially the path detection is not quite there. WebStorm can even read the HTML file for Angular code
            so it is the best of all.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use the latest version of the compiler (as of August 2015 it was 1.5.3) </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Installation of TypeScript</h2>
        The following information is actually documented well. Nevertheless, I did get "stuck" with these issues
        when I was trying to make myself familiar with it. So they might also help you.
        <ol>
            <li>Install Node.js This installs also npm which we will need for subsequent configurations. </li>
            <li><code>sudo npm install -g tsc</code> Installs Typescript compiler. If you are on windows omit sudo but you
            have to be an admin user.</li>
            <li><code>sudo npm install -g tsd</code> Installs the Typescript definition manager.
            This is needed to import the "intellisense" definitions for Visual Studio and WebStorm.</li>
            <li>Install bower by <code>npm install -g bower</code> Most packages use this to install js and css</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Initial Setup</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Start with the plain Angular Seed project. It contains handy package.json</li>
            <li>At the root of the seed project do <code>npm install</code> This will install most of what you will need</li>
            <li>If you are using bootstrap either do <code>bower install bootstrap</code> or edit bower.json and add
            <code>"bootstrap": "~3.3.5"</code></li>
            <li>If you are only developing in the app directory <code>cd app</code>, otherwise I would create the
            typings files at the root by not cd to app.</li>
            <li>Now the most of the stuff is set up, bring in the type def files by<br/>
            <code>tsd install "angular*"</code> Granted this will install a whole lot of stuff you may not need
            you could save a lot of time not needing to cherry-pick each definition.</li>
            <li>Now that the files are in place you can include the reference to the 'd' files by doing things like
            <code>/// &lt;reference path="../scripts/typings/angularjs/angular.d.ts" /&gt; at the start
            of your ts source code.</code></li>
        </ul>
        <h1>The Module Name Mystery Solved</h1>
        <P>I've looked at several Angular/TS examples, and a great number of them to not assign the angular module name.
        So it took me some efforts to find out how to do this. Do remember though, your TS code can intermix the plain
        old JavaScript code as well.</P>
        <P>For this to work smoothly in IDE, you will need to make sure that the typings directory especially the
            typings/angularjs/angular.d.ts reference is properly made in source code.</P>
        <h2>The Key to Assigning Module Names</h2>
        <p>Here is a concrete example how this is accomplished.</p>
        <p><code>angular.module("Products", []).controller("Products.Controller", Products.Controller);</code></p>
        In this example, I have essentially created a module called "Products" then added to it the controller
        name of "Products.Controller" and attached the Products (a TypeScript Module), and a class of Controller.
        <p>
            This is a stand-alone function (to a static call) and you could insert this statement inside the constructor of a class OR
            somewhere completely external. For example after the class definition {} but before the module's closing }
            bracket.
        </p>
        <p>
            A typical error made by the Angular developers for module declaration (even without TypeScript) is that the module call can
            serve two purposes, one is to define it and another is to retrieve it. The only difference
            between the two is the string array parameter
            after the module name. If the string array is not provided, then it's a signal to retrieve the
            named module. If the string array is the <b>required</b> items, and this can be an empty string but it
            cannot be omitted to initiate a module.
        </p>
